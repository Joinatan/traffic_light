Here\textquotesingle{}s documentation for the code in the traffic light controller. It implements tasks 1, 2 and 3.\hypertarget{index_Navigation}{}\doxysection{Navigation}\label{index_Navigation}
Under classes you can easily get an overwiew of the classes used in the code. Since Cube\+MX generates it\textquotesingle{}s code the way it does it\textquotesingle{}s to painful to create a classbased approach to the rtos implementation. Because of that you\textquotesingle{}ll find all rtos specifics like tasks and semaphores under Files tab and in \mbox{\hyperlink{freertos_8cpp}{freertos.\+cpp}}. \hypertarget{index_Clarifications}{}\doxysection{Clarifications}\label{index_Clarifications}
I cleaned out all the documented code that wasn\textquotesingle{}t generated by me. My car switches can seem to behave backwards. There is no car if the switch is in position farthest from the crossing. In \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}} I only included the global LEDS bytes that i define there. There\textquotesingle{}s some more happening there like settings for shift registers and starting rtos kernel but I don\textquotesingle{}t think it\textquotesingle{}s necessary to put that in this documentation. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
